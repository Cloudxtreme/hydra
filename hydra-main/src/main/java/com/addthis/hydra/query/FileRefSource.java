/**
 * Supports multi-producer (server-to-server) file ref collection in a lock-free manner. This class is only
 * thread-safe for the meshy-facing components though, and should not be concurrently accessed from user code.
 *
 * It uses a lock-free multi-producer/ single-consumer queue implementation from netty with some extra logic to
 * support blocking/timed polls (the netty version only implements {@link Queue} and not {@link BlockingQueue}).
 * The implementation of the blocking strives to avoid random sleeping or spin-blocking by using a {@link StampedLock}
 * as a sort of binary semaphore. This gets us the park/unpark semantics we want without having to either directly
 * implement that logic or throw away the spin-then-park loop optimizations that doug lee et al already benchmarked.
 *
 * There may be a "better" way to accomplish this than to use a {@link StampedLock}, but its code seems to suggest
 * that it does a pretty efficient job at handling the methods we expect to call at their respective frequencies.
